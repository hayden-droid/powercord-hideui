# powercord-hideui
A Powercord plugin to hide unwanted UI elements.

## Notes
If you have other plugins that provide settings panels, some features *may* not appear to be working - if that happens just let me know and I'll update this plugin to fix them.

## how to install on powercord
`git clone https://github.com/hayden-droid/powercord-hideui/`
